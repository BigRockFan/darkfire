# Darkfire
NHACKS 4 project - full, original, 4-player game played with controllers

# Inspiration
We had a vision of creating a great 2D video game that was completely personal to us and still had the great aspects of a video game

# How It Works
The game is played by plugging in 4 console controllers into the computer. Altrenatively, characters can be moved through the keyboard but 
a full experience requires controllers.

# Game Mechanics
There is one character named Darkfire. He has numerous abilities and has much more power than the other characters. But he is alone against
them all. The remaining 3 characters are heroes all teaming up to fight Darkfire. So the objective of the game is to kill enemies and have 
your team win.

# Modules Used (external libraries)
This video game was created using Pygame, a prominent graphics and game design module in python.

# Our Storyline
Began at NHACKS 4. Project developed over a month after the hackathon (Operation Create). We developed the code across many computers
and constantly sent around code to keep up to date
